        <h1 className='whatis' >What is Computer Science Enginneering?</h1>
        <h4 className='content'>  Computer Science Engineering is a 4 years course that deals with design, implementation, and management of information systems of both software & hardware processes. A computer scientist specializes in theory of computation and design of computational systems. Computer Science engineering aids with 
        various disciplines such as electrical and electronics engineering, information technology, software engineering, and more. 

Computer Science Engineering courses are offered at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in the form of B.E, B.Tech, or M.Tech degree programmes. B.Tech in computer science is popular at UG, whereas M.Tech in computer science is popular at PG levels After completing a degree programme in computer science, candidates can find various entry-level jobs in the IT industry or related fields, given they fulfill the 
required skill set such as knowledge of subjects like programming, database management, data structures and more.</h4>

     <h4 className="content">
     The first computer engineering degree program in the United States was established in 1971 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.[17] As of 2015, there were 250 ABET-accredited computer engineering programs in the U.S.[18] In Europe, accreditation of computer engineering schools is done by a variety of agencies part of the EQANIE network. Due to increasing job requirements for engineers who can concurrently design hardware, software, firmware, and manage all forms of computer systems used in industry, some tertiary institutions around the world offer a bachelor's degree generally called computer engineering. Both computer engineering and electronic engineering programs include analog and digital circuit design in their curriculum. As with most engineering disciplines, having a sound knowledge of mathematics and science is necessary for computer engineers.
